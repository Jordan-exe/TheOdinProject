    <h1>How to use images based on file type</h1>
    <h2>. jpg</h2>
    <p>Designed to handle large color palettes without
        increasing file size dramatically</p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="A mochi jpg">
    <p>That is a jpg image</p>

    <h2>. gif</h2>
    <p>The go-to options for simple animations,
         but they are limited in color palette. Never use them for photos. 
         Pixels in a gif are either transparent or opaque, no in between. 
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="mochi gif">
    <p>That's a gif file</p>

    <h2>. png</h2>
    <p>Great for anything that isn' a photos 
        or an animation. Ideal for icons, diagrams, logos, etc.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="mochi png">
    <p>Here is a png file</p>

    <h2>. svg</h2>
    <p>SVG is a vector-based graphics format, rather than pixel-based like 
        the above formats. This means it can scale up or down
         to <em>any</em> dimension without loss of quality. They're
         good for basically the same uses as PNG. You should
         use them whenever you can.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.svg" alt="mochi svg">
    <p>That's an svg file</p>
    <p>There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them 
        to display consistently across browsers, you need to 
        convert any text fields to outlines using your image
         editor. If your image contains lots of text, it will 
         have a big impact on file size.
    </p>

    <h2>Image Dimensions</h2>
    <p>By default, the img element inherits the dimensions 
        of the image file. Those jpg, gif, png images are 
        150x150 pixel, while the svg is 75x75.
    </p>
    <p>Pixel-based image formats need to be twice as big as you want
         them to appear on retina displays. We can scale 
         our pixel-based images down in size by using 
         the img attribute width='75'.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" alt="jpg" width="75">
    <img src="../images/mochi.gif" alt="gif" width="75">
    <img src="../images/mochi.png" alt="png" width="75">

    <p>Those were all scaled down to 75px width</p>

    <p> <strong> This is just an example of scaling, we should 
        be scaling images with CSS using media queries.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>How about scaling the svg up by a multiple of 10 to 750 width?</p>

    <img src="../images/mochi.svg" alt="svg" width="750">

    <p><em>Still</em> crispy!!!</p>
